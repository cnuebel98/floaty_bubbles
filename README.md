# Ellipses is only srawn if:
# - it's smallest inner diameter is at least one third of the size of its biggest diameter
# - it's smallest diameter is at least 150 pixel long
# - it's biggest diameter is not bigger than half the frame width
# - when two ellipses are oberlapping: only draw the bigger one

# - idea: what if we put in more particles or ignore the top part of the frame?
